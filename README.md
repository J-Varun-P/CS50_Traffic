These are the following observations that I noticed after running Neural Network models for over a hundred times for this project.

Convolutional Layers are pretty important for Neural Network models including images since these Convolutional Layers draw out different feature maps that help in improving the accuracy of a model. For this project, the more the number of different Convolutional Layers, the better was the accuracy of the model. The only drawback of adding more Convolutional Layers is the increased computation time in training the model. Also after a few different Convolutional Layers the accuracy of the model didn't change much upon adding further Convolutional Layers. The size of kernels used in Convolutional Layers also matter in determining the accuracy of a model. For this project, ( 2 * 2 ) kernel performed worse than ( 3 * 3 ) or ( 4 * 4 ) kernels. As the size of kernels increased over a specific value ( kernel size > ( 4 * 4 ) ) the accuracy of the model also decreased along the way. The more the number of filters on a specific sized kernel, the more was the computation time but the accuracy of the model remained more or less the same expect when the number of filters were very high ( number of filters > 64 ) in which case accuracy of the model got worse.
